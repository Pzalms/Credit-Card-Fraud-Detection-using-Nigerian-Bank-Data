# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Nigerian-Bank-Data
A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM FOR CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS FRAUD DETECTION OF BANK TRANSACTION (Nigerian Bank Dataset template)

The project undergoes an Exploratory Data Analysis, with the inclusion of an WebSite for testing the proposed detection methods.

Additional, inclusion of a project report.

In recent years credit card fraud has become one of the growing problems. A large financial loss has greatly affected individual person using credit card and also the merchants and banks. Machine learning is considered as one of the most successful technique to identify the fraud. This work reviews different fraud detection techniques using machine learning and compare them using performance measure like accuracy, precision and specificity. The paper also proposes a supervised Random Forest algorithm. With this proposed system the accuracy of detecting fraud in credit card is increased. Further, the proposed system uses learning to rank approach to rank the alert and also effectively addresses the problem of fraud detection.
